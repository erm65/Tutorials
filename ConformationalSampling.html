    <h1>Conformational sampling</h1>
    <h2> Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1.Setup of the starting 3D structure</h3>
    <h4>Case 1. The structure is downloaded by a X-Ray database (CSD or PDB)</h4>
    <p>Load the structure in a <a href="#Software">software of editing/viewing</a>
      structures and carefully check if the structure is correct.Finally, the
      file should be saved in mol2 format.</p>
    <h4>Case 2. The structure is build through the SMILES code</h4>
    <p>The SMILES can could be obtained in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>it can be downloaded from various sources, e.g. ChemSpider</li>
      <li>the molecule is drawn in MarvinSketch and then is copied as SMILES
        using the option "Edit - Copy as SMILES".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The code is converted in a 3D structure using CORINA (<a href="https://www.mn-am.com/online_demos/corina_demo">https://www.mn-am.com/online_demos/corina_demo</a>).
      So far, CORINA represents the most robust SMILES converter. In particular,
      it is able to efficiently handle chiral symbols.</p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 2. Check of the structure</h3>
    <p> The check of the structure is mandatory and fundamental before
      submitting the structure to the next steps.</p>
    <p>In particular, these properties must be checked:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bond order</li>
      <li>Atoms valency</li>
      <li>Formal atom charge (and molecule charge)</li>
      <li>Ionization</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Furthermore, it is better to check the name of the molecule and the name
      of the residue.</p>
    <p>Two fields should be carefully checked and modified if it is required:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>@&lt;TRIPOS&gt;MOLECULE: the name should be checked and modified
        deleting extensions, directory tree and other not useful names. In
        principle, the name of the molecule should be identical to the name of
        the file.</li>
      <li>@&lt;TRIPOS&gt;ATOM: after the the subs_id, the ID number of the
        substructure containing the atom, the subs_name should be chosen
        accordingly to the file name and preferably with three letters. The name
        should be changed using the "replace" tool in every editor software
        (e.g. Notepad+). Pay attention to the last field in the file
        (@&lt;TRIPOS&gt;SUBSTRUCTURE) where the name should be defined and thus
        it also has to be replaced.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>atom_id atom_name x y z atom_type [subst_id [subst_name [charge
          [status_bit]]]</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3><a id="Software">Software of editing and/or viewing</a> </h3>
    <h5>Maestro (to try)</h5>
    <p>Free version for academics. It is an editing/viewing software.
      Interestingly, it assigns automatically the bond order to the molecules.</p>
    <h5>MOE (best avoided)</h5>
    <p>Commercial software that allows viewing and editing of small and big
      molecules.</p>
    <h5>Avogadro 1</h5>
    <p>Software that allows viewing and editing of small molecules.</p>
    <h5>Chimera</h5>
    <p>Chimera allows viewing and editing.It can be used to clean the file, e.g.
      it is possible to delete the protein portion of the file.</p>
    <h4>Vega</h4>
    <p>Vega allows a complete editing, e.g. it is possible to change the bond
      order</p>
    <h4>Vida</h4>
    <p>Vida is useful when the editing is not mandatory and it a visual check is
      sufficient.</p>
