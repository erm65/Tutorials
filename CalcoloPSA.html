    <h1>Calcolo della Polar Surface Area</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> The Polar Surface Area (PSA) is ...</p>
    <p>PSA is calculated following various protocols.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>PSA calculation accordin Matteo's protocol</h2>
    <h3>Matteo's plugin</h3>
    <p>Copy the following lines in a file named psa_3d.py located in
      c:\PyMOL_Installation</p>
    <div id="Instr">from pymol import cmd<br>
      def psa3d (arg1=0.6, arg2=-0.6):<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;obj_list = cmd.get_names('objects') <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;for obj in obj_list: <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cmd.select('noh',
      '(pc.&gt;'+str(arg1)+'|pc.&lt;'+str(arg2)+'|(e. n OR e. o OR e. h
      AND(neighbor e. n OR e. o))) AND ' + obj)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print("3DPSA_noh06 %12s %.3f" %
      (obj, cmd.get_area('noh'))) <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;return obj<br>
      cmd.extend("psa3d", psa3d)</div>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Run PyMOL</p>
    <p>Click on Plugin - Plugin Manager - Install New Plugin - Choose file</p>
    <p>Choose psa_3d.py in the directory c:\PyMOL_Installation</p>
    <p>Click Ok</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If all is ok a messagge will be shown that inform you that the plugin
        has been installed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Check on the Plugin Manager that the&nbsp; plugin is installed&nbsp; and
      close it.</p>
    <p>The plugin is ready.</p>
    <p>Load a molecule and type psa3d in the PyMOL command window</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It should be possible that it is necessary to exit and rerun PyMOL to
        activate the plugin</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When the plugin works, the PSA (SA 3D PSA – NOH+0.6) could be calculated
      with the following instruction:</p>
    <div id="Instr">
      <p>set solvent_radius=1.4; set dot_density=4; set dot_solvent=1; psa3d</p>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <h3></h3>
    <h3>Protocol</h3>
    <h4>Structure preparation</h4>
    <p>The application of the protocol requires to start with one or more
      minimized conformations in mol2 format.</p>
    <p>The minimized structure or structures can be the result of a
      conformational sampling or they can be obtained experimentally. The
      structures should be checked for bond orders, ionization state, etc but in
      principle these checks should be already done. To be sure that all is ok,
      it is suggested a new check using Maestro.</p>
    <h4>Charge calculation</h4>
    <p>Partial charges are calculated using <b>PM3</b> semi-empirical method
      implemented in Spartan.</p>
    <p>Launch Spartan.</p>
    <p>Click on <i>File </i>- <i>Open</i> and chose the directory with the
      mol2 files, then change the extension selection to <i>All Files</i>.
      Finally, chose the mol2 files. <i>Open</i>.</p>
    <p>Click on Setup - Calculations</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In Calculate, chose Energy, Semi-Empirical, PM3, Gas</li>
      <li>Select Global Calculations to submit all the molecules</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If more mol2 files were opened, each calculation must be performed
          separately</li>
        <li>If a multi-mol2 file was opened, the option Global Calculations
          allows you to run calculations for all the molecules</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Submit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Chose the name of the file</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain the same name of mol2 file but delete the extension</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Check the submission using <i>Options </i>- <i>Monitor</i></p>
    <p>When the calculations finish, save the results, <i>File - Save</i>.</p>
    <p>Finally, save the results in mol2 format with charges, File - Save As</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chose the name: in the suggested name change <i>.spartan</i> with <i>_PM3.mol2</i>
      </li>
      <li>Save and chose Electrostatic charges, Ok.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>PSA calculation with PyMol</h4>
    <p>3D PSA is calculated in <b>PyMol </b>1.7.0.1.</p>
    <p>The calculated surfaces include definitions where polar atoms were
      defined as nitrogen, oxygen and attached hydrogens or extended to include
      atoms with absolute partial charge greater than the threshold specified
      (0.6). </p>
    <p>Both molecular surface area (probe radius = 0 Å) and solvent accessible
      surface area (probe radius = 1.4 Å) were calculated in PyMol.</p>
    <p>Pymol 3D PSA commands:</p>
    <p><b>SA 3D PSA</b> – NOH+0.6 was calculated by running the following
      command:</p>
    <div id="Instr">set solvent_radius=1.4; set dot_density=4; set
      dot_solvent=1; psa3d </div>
    <p>M 3D PSA – NOH+0.6 was calculated by running the following command:</p>
    <div id="Instr">set dot_density=4; set dot_solvent=0; psa3d</div>
    <p>where a Pymol plugin enabled calculation of 3D PSA for all objects in the
      current session (see <a href="PyMol.html">PyMol</a> for installation
      instructions).</p>
    <p>The minimum value of <b>SA 3D PSA</b> was correlated with permeability
      in Matteo's paper.</p>
