    <h1>Number of IMHBs (Chimera)</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>IMHBs are found on the basis of atom types and geometrical criteria.</p>
    <p>Possible donor groups are hydrogen-bearing nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur
      atoms, and possible acceptor groups are nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms
      with a lone pair. H-bonds involving other types of atoms are not
      considered.</p>
    <p>The geometric criteria are based on a survey of small-molecule crystal
      structures, as described in Mills, J.E.J.; Dean P.M. Journal of
      Computer-Aided Molecular Design, 10 (1996) 607-622.</p>
    <h2>Data input</h2>
    <p>Conformers must be formatted as multi-pdb files.</p>
    <p>Generally, the output of the conformational sampling is in multi-mol2
      format, thus it must be converted.</p>
