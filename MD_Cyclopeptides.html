    <h1>MD: cyclopeptides</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>How setup a MD simulation for a cyclopeptide</p>
    <p>The cyclopeptide has to be built following particular protocol to be sure
      that it is considered as a cyclopeptide in GROMACS and in other software.</p>
    <h2>How build the&nbsp; cyclopeptide</h2>
    <h3>Build of the cyclopeptide using Vega</h3>
    <p> Open Vega</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the installation is required, the link to the software is <a href="https://nova.disfarm.unimi.it/cms/index.php">https://nova.disfarm.unimi.it/cms/index.php</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Open the peptide builder Modify - Build - Peptide</p>
    <p>Write the sequence in the windows using the one-letter code for the amino
      acids</p>
    <p>Click on the<i> Add lateral chains</i> option and choose alpha helix
      structure</p>
    <p>Finally, click on the build button</p>
    <p>Now, use Modify - Remove - Atom to delete two hydrogen atoms on the
      N-terminus and the hydrogen on the C-terminus</p>
    <p>Then, use Modify - Add - Bonds and connect the N-terminus with the C-
      terminus</p>
    <p>Calculate - Charge &amp; Potential end select GAFF_SMARTS as Force Field
      and Ammp-Mom as charges</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It should be work but other charges can be used because here we want
        to prepare a starting structure to submit to GROMACS that will
        recalculate charges</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Calculate - Ammp - Minimization</p>
    <p>Firstly, use default parameter and Truncated-Newton to minimize the
      structure, if necessary repeat this step</p>
    <p>Calculate - Ramachandran Plot</p>
    <p>If the cyclopeptide shows a good distribution in the Ramachandran plot
      then the structure is ok otherwise try to minimize with the genetic
      algorithm </p>
    <p>To obtain other starting structure, it is possible to use the
      conformational analysis tool</p>
    <p>Calculate - Ammp - Conformational search</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the windows click on <i>Modify torsions</i></li>
      <li>In the new window Modify - Add proteic torsions - Phi and Psi and then
        close the window</li>
      <li>Run the conformational search using all default parameters and <i>Boltzmann
          jump</i> or <i>Random </i>method</li>
      <li>Minimize structure and check the Ramachandran plot</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When at least one satisfactory model is obtained, it is possible to use
      the model as starting point for the next steps</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It should be useful to obtain more than one model</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Prepare cyclopeptide in GROMACS</h3>
    <p>We follow the instruction in <a href="https://github.com/visvaldask/gmx_makecyclictop">https://github.com/visvaldask/gmx_makecyclictop</a>
      using the Perl script downloadable in the same github site</p>
    <p>First step, take your cyclic peptide/nucleotide pdb file and imagine it’s
      linear (for a moment).</p>
    <p>Add using text editor additional 2 additional residues to N and C
      termini.</p>
    <p>The additional residues should be as follows. The one added in the
      beginning should be taken from the end, and the one added to the end
      should be taken from the beginning.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delete the bond section of the pdb file</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Next step is renumbering residues (by hand) - important. Renumber first
      and last residues by hand so that they follow one after another; the first
      will be 0, and the last will be N+1, where N is the number of the amino
      acids in the cyclic peptide.</p>
    <p>The atom numbering is in a mess but it’s not important, just the residue
      numbers are important.</p>
    <p>Next run your edited file (let's say myfile.pdb) through GROMACS using
      command something like: </p>
    <div id="Instr">gmx pdb2gmx -f myfile.pdb -o myfile_gmx.pdb</div>
    <p>GROMACS creates topology file, write down it’s name (probably topol.top,
      but could be something else, like .itp file; if .itp is created, you
      should use it instead of .top for step 3)</p>
    <p>Now run the perl script on that top file:</p>
    <p>gmx_makecyclictop.pl topfile</p>
    <p>where topfile is the topology file created in step (2)</p>
    <p>The script creates new topology file, e.g. topol_cyc.top.</p>
    <p>Now we just have to make sure we have the PDB (or GRO) file matching it.</p>
    <p>For this, delete the residues added at step (1) from the GROMACS
      generated file (myfile_gmx.pdb)</p>
    <p>Let's say the edited myfile_gmx.pdb without the first and last residues
      is named myfile_gmx_edit.pdb</p>
    <p>Use that file for your simulation purposes, e.g. convert it to GRO and
      add simulation box:</p>
    <div id="Instr">gmx editconf -f myfile_gmx_edit.pdb -o myfile_gmx_edit.gro -bt cubic -d
      1.0</div>
    <p>Use myfile_gmx_edit.gro and topol_cyc.top for futher GROMACS simulations.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
