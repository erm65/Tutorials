    <title>Preparation of the starting molecular structure</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Setup of the starting 3D structure</h1>
    <h2>Structure creation</h2>
    <h3>Case 1. The structure is downloaded by a X-Ray database (CSD or PDB)</h3>
    <p>Run Maestro</p>
    <p>Select&nbsp; a convenient working directory: <i>File </i>- <i>Change
        Working Directory</i> and select the directory</p>
    <p>Import starting structures: <i>File </i>- <i>Import Structures</i></p>
    <p>Carefully check if the structure is correct and eventually use edit tools
      to correct the structure and delete not useful atoms (e.g. solvent) </p>
    <h3>Case 2. The structure is build through the SMILES code</h3>
    <p>The SMILES can be obtained in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>it can be downloaded from various sources, e.g. ChemSpider</li>
      <li>the molecule is drawn in MarvinSketch and then is copied as SMILES
        using the option <i>Edit </i>- <i>Copy as SMILES</i>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conversion of SMILES in a 3D structure</h2>
    <p>The SMILES conversion depends on the project and it very <b style="color: red;">IMPORTANT
        </b>to establish is the project is under a disclosure agreement with a
      company or not.</p>
    <p><span style="color: red;">Before starting with the following steps, ask
        to your director</span>.</p>
    <h3>The molecule is not involved in a disclosure agreement</h3>
    <p>The code is converted in a 3D structure using CORINA (<a href="https://www.mn-am.com/online_demos/corina_demo">https://www.mn-am.com/online_demos/corina_demo</a>)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>So far, CORINA represents the most robust SMILES converter</li>
      <li>In particular, it is able to efficiently handle chiral symbols</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In Corina, save the structure as mol file to maintain information about
      bond order.</p>
    <h3>The molecule is involved in a disclosure agreement</h3>
    <p>The molecule cannot be prepared using online tools because they do not
      guarantee disclosure agreement conditions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the drawn molecule in MarvinSketch</li>
      <li>Click on <i>Structure </i>- <i>Clean in 3D</i></li>
      <li><i>File </i>- <i>Save As</i> - <i>select mol2 option</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the same name of Marvin file</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Check the structure (see below)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Check of the structure</h2>
    <p> The check of the structure is mandatory and fundamental before
      submitting the structure to the next steps.</p>
    <p>Use Maestro (educational or registered version) to load, edit and check
      the structure.</p>
    <p>In particular, these properties must be checked:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bond order</li>
      <li>Atoms valency</li>
      <li>Formal atom charge (and molecule charge)</li>
      <li>Ionization</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Furthermore, it is better to check the name of the molecule and the name
      of the residue loading the structure in an editing software</p>
    <p>Two fields should be carefully checked and modified if it is required:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>@&lt;TRIPOS&gt;MOLECULE: the name should be checked and modified
        deleting extensions, directory tree and other not useful names. In
        principle, the name of the molecule should be identical to the name of
        the file.</li>
      <li>@&lt;TRIPOS&gt;ATOM: after the the subs_id, the ID number of the
        substructure containing the atom, the subs_name should be chosen
        accordingly to the file name and preferably with three letters. The name
        should be changed using the "replace" tool in every editor software
        (e.g. Notepad+). Pay attention to the last field in the file
        (@&lt;TRIPOS&gt;SUBSTRUCTURE) where the name should be defined and thus
        it also has to be replaced.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>atom_id atom_name x y z atom_type [subst_id [subst_name [charge
          [status_bit]]]</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>File </i>- <i>Change Working Directory</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Select the directory where there is the structure of interest</li>
      </ul>
      <li><i>File </i>- <i>Import Structures</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Select the file with the 3D structure (e.g. the mol2 file prepared
          with MarvinSketch)</li>
        <li>Generally, click to import with default options</li>
      </ul>
      <li>If the file contains unnecessary atoms (e.g. solvent molecules in
        files retrieved from CSD or PDB)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the <i>Workspace Navigator</i> to select the parts of molecule
          that you wants to delete or select the molecule and then invert
          selection to delete all it is not necessary</li>
      </ul>
      <li><i>Select </i>- <i>All</i></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Edit </i>- <i>Assign </i>- <i>Bond orders</i> </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Bond orders are automatically assigned</li>
        <li>Check that the assignment is correct</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Then, use <i>Build </i>- <i>Draw </i>tool to eventually correct
        the molecule using the 2D representation as reference</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Finally, <i>Select </i>- <i>All </i>and <i>Add Hydrogens</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Any missing hydrogen atoms are added</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>When the structure is edited, export the file as mol2 format: <i>File
        </i>- <i>Export Structures</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>If the name of input and output files are the same you can overwrite
          the input file that is not useful</li>
        <li>Exit from Maestro</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Generally, it is not necessary to save the project</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Finally, the checked structure is saved in a file mol.mol2, where <i>mol
          </i>is the name of the molecule.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The name <i>mol </i>will be kept for all steps thus a short name
          should be chosen.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: red;"><i>To be edit</i>. Furthermore, the <i>mol </i>name
        should be also abbreviated with a 3 letters short name that will be
        saved in the Tripos MOLECULE field and will be used in the subs_name
        field in the ATOM lines (the field where the name of the amino acids are
        reported) into the mol2 file.</span></p>
